    "    Currently we only compare clauses of our RAG database with uploaded user TA. No way to compare and say what clauses must be in the TA. Maybe we can include that in the prompt, instead of using RAG for this part? Like \"Tenancy agreement should have a, b, c, d clauses at minimum and most will also have e, f clauses\" Also need to figure out how to integrate legal documents into RAG 1 to help explain legality of certain clauses. Right now it just compares clauses in user TA to clauses in RAG database"

This is a deviation from the ideal clause which clearly states these conditions.\n",

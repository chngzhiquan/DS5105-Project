Maybe we can include that in the prompt, instead of using RAG for this part? Like \"Tenancy agreement should have a, b, c, d clauses at minimum and most will also have e, f clauses\" Also need to figure out how to integrate legal documents into RAG 1 to help explain legality of certain clauses. Right now it just compares clauses in user TA to clauses in RAG database"
